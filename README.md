# ANA-505-WK6
## Create a new GitHub repository for ANA 505 Week 6 Activity.  Create a ReadMe file that describes the three scripts.


### SVM-- 
**SVM accuracy: 97.33%** <br>
Support vector machine separates data into categories with something that looks like a linear treatment (hyperplane). I found it interesting that the algorithm chose to hedge in "veriscolor" (and giving the category as little space as possible) while giving "setosa" so much room (when it was the one that was easily delineated from the other two species).

### K Means--
**K Means accuracy: 88.67%** <br>
K-means has been one of the algorithms I've struggled to understand. If I'm understanding it correctly, it basically categorizes the data into groups (in this case based off petal/sepal lengths and widths). I'm not 100% clear on how this produces different results than SVM -- 3d vs 2d (I'm looking at the paper analogy)?

### C50--
**C50 accuracy: 93.3%** <br>
C50 creates a decision tree based off machine learning with data for things that have already been classified. Supervised learning; "incorporates pruning... to mitigate overfitting."
